How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area temporarily stores the files that are ready for being committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
working directory -> (git add) -> staging area -> (git commit) -> repository
git add [file]
git commit -m ["message"]
git status # check the status of staging area
git diff # without any option, find difference between files in working directory and files in staging area

git checkout master

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
git branch [branch_name] # make a new branch
git checkout [branch_name] # switch to the branch

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
git checkout -b [branch_name] # make a new branch and switch to it immediately

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
git log --graph --oneline
git merge [branch_1] [branch_2]
git branch -d [branch_2]

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
git log -n 1 # show (n=1) log entry
