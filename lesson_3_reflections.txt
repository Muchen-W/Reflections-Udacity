When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

git remote # check the connection status to the remote GitHub from local
git remote add [origin] [https link of GitHub repo] # connect GitHub repository to the local called origin by attaching the url link of the repo.
git push origin master # push all commits of local master branch that GitHub repo does not include to origin (GitHub repo)
git pull origin master # pull all commits from origin (GitHub repo) that does not exist at local to the local master branch

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork: GitHub repo -> GitHub repo
clone: GitHub repo -> local repo; git clone [url]
branch: local repo -> local repo; git branch [branch_name]; git checkout [branch_name] || git checkout -b [branch_name]
