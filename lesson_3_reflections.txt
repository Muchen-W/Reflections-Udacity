1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

git remote # check the connection status to the remote GitHub from local
git remote add [origin] [https link of GitHub repo] # connect GitHub repository to the local called origin by attaching the url link of the repo.
git push origin master # push all commits of local master branch that GitHub repo does not include to origin (GitHub repo)
git pull origin master # pull all commits from origin (GitHub repo) that does not exist at local to the local master branch

2. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork: GitHub repo -> GitHub repo
clone: GitHub repo -> local repo; git clone [url]
branch: local repo -> local repo; git branch [branch_name]; git checkout [branch_name] || git checkout -b [branch_name]

3. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
git fetch + git merge [master] [origin/master] <==> git pull origin master # sync/merge conflicted copies from local repo and GitHub repo # 'git pull' is a 'fast-merge'

4. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
git push <origin_name> <branch_name> # push local branch to branch at GitHub repo
